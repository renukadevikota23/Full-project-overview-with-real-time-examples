## 🌐 Project Overview

The **Multi-User Training and Testing Interface** is a real-time, web-based platform designed to streamline the development and evaluation of machine learning models across multiple users. It enables **simultaneous user access**, allowing individuals or teams to **train, test, and monitor ML models in real time**—making it ideal for research labs, educational environments, or collaborative AI development projects.

### 🎯 Key Objectives

* Provide a **centralized, real-time interface** for model training and evaluation.
* Allow multiple users to **work independently or collaboratively** in isolated sessions.
* Enable **dynamic interaction with models**, including live metrics, logs, and visualizations.
* Support a wide variety of ML workflows including **classification, regression, NLP, and image processing**.

### ⚙️ Real-Time Capabilities

* ✅ **Live Training Updates** – Users receive real-time visual feedback on training progress (e.g., loss, accuracy, epoch stats).
* ✅ **Instant Testing Results** – Submit inputs and view model predictions without delay.
* ✅ **Concurrent Sessions** – Backend supports multiple user sessions simultaneously without performance conflicts.
* ✅ **Collaborative Sharing** – Users can optionally share trained models or datasets with team members instantly.
* ✅ **Real-Time Notifications** – Alerts for training completion, errors, or system updates.

### 👥 Use Cases

* **AI Labs & Research Groups** – Collaborate on models and datasets with real-time progress sharing.
* **Classroom Environments** – Students can learn ML concepts hands-on with live model training.
* **Startup Teams** – Quickly prototype and evaluate AI models with shared infrastructure.
* **Hackathons** – Fast-paced collaborative ML development in real time.
